We really like product design at Netherton Solutions, so we decided we wanted to be a part of it and support it as much as possible.  The best way we can do that is to provide access to a robust, reliable FDM printer, which we found in the Makerbot Replicator.

This printer comes out of the box pretty much ready to run, and has been working extremely well during our initial testing phase.  Makerbot provides a desktop client to prepare prints, as well as a mobile app that allows remote monitoring of the printer's status.  That includes live images of the build thanks to a built-in camera!

With a build envelope of roughly 10 x 8 x 6" (w x d x h), many small parts and even medium sized parts can be printed in a single print run.  

This 3D printer uses 1.75mm PLA (polylactic acid) plastic filament.  While limited to a single colour, many filament colours are available, currently including:

* red
* orange
* yellow
* green
* blue
* purple
* black
* light grey
* medium grey
* black

More colours are available, please contact us for further information.
